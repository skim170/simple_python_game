## "Don't say that number!" (python_game)

This is a game called "Don't say that number!" The game involves two players taking turns and incrementing a game number without matching or exceeding a randomly selected "Number of DOOM." The first player to reach a certain score threshold wins the game.  

Objective: The objective of the game is to avoid being the player who says a number that matches or exceeds a randomly selected "Number of DOOM." The first player to reach a certain score threshold, typically winning two out of three rounds, wins the game.

Gameplay:

1. Setup:
- The game starts with an initial game number set to zero.
- A random "Number of DOOM" is generated, typically between 20 and 40.
- The game consists of a series of rounds (usually three rounds), where players take turns.
2. Turns:
- The players take turns, starting with Player One.
- On a player's turn, they are prompted to input how many numbers they want to say on that turn, which must be between 1 and 3.
- After specifying the number of numbers to say, the player's goal is to increment the game number by saying those numbers without causing it to reach or exceed the "Number of DOOM."
3. Scoring:
- If a player successfully says the numbers without causing the game number to reach or exceed the "Number of DOOM," they win the current round.
- The player who wins a round earns a point.
4. Winning the Game:
- The game is typically played in a "best of three" format, meaning the first player to win two rounds wins the overall game.
- The game continues until one player wins two rounds, or until all rounds are completed.
- The player who wins two rounds first is declared the winner of the game.

Game Over:
- Once the game is over (a player has won two rounds), the game ends, and the winner is announced.
